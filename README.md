Unit testing involves verifying the correctness of individual units of code, like methods or functions, in isolation from the rest of the application. Unit tests are written by programmers to test small pieces of functionality within larger programs. In C#, unit tests can be created using frameworks like MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit. The process involves defining test cases that cover various scenarios and asserting the expected behavior of the code under test. Unit tests help ensure that changes made to the codebase do not introduce unintended side effects or regressions. A unit test project is a separate project from the production project, created typically in Visual Studio.
