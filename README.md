Unit testing involves verifying the correctness of individual units of code, like methods or functions, in isolation from the rest of the application. Unit tests are written by programmers to test small pieces of functionality within larger programs. In C#, unit tests can be created using frameworks like MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit. The process involves defining test cases that cover various scenarios and asserting the expected behavior of the code under test. Unit tests help ensure that changes made to the codebase do not introduce unintended side effects or regressions. A unit test project is a separate project from the production project, created typically in Visual Studio. N Unit Testing: The N unit Testing is one of the mostly used Framework of Unit Testing(ASP.NET Core). "MStest and xUnit Testing" are other most popular unit testing Frameworks. NUnit is a unti testing framework for" all.Net Languages". It has support of" .NET 5 and .NET Core" frameworks. It helps to run the testing in a particular " 1.Ordered 2.Sequence 3.Parallel" NUnit Testing can be executed using "Command line"with different parameters too. It has many "in built attributes that are used to design/Decorate the C# method as a testing method. And NUnit has Assertions which will help to judge a testing by "Pass/Fail". "Lambda Test" is a testing platform. Setuping NUnit in Visual Studio Create new project by Choosing NUnit(.NET Framework/Core)
